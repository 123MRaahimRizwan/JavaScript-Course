const author = "Raahim";
console.log(author)
let b = "Raahim";
// let b = 45; This code will throw an error b/c you cannot redeclare let
{
  let b = "This is Raahim";
  console.log(b);
}
console.log(b);
// This example shows that let is block scoped
// var can introduce bugs in your code so it is better to use let and use const to declare constants.
