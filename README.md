# Javascript Course

1. This repository contains all the files of the [Code With Harry JavaScript Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9ahR1blWXxgSlL4y9iQBnLpR), I have started learning JavaScript recently from this course available for free on YouTube. 

2. This repo also contains the handwritten notes for the JavaScript programming language.

3. I will highly encourage you to learn from this course.
Happy Learning !!
